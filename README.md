how to make red velvet cake reciepe step by step........

step1. first preheatyour owen to 350 f (176 C). Next let's make our cake better. start by creaming your butter and your white granulated or caster sugar together in a large bowl. use a hand mixer or stand mixer to do this.

step2. Now we add in our eggs one at a time. So drop one egg in, mix ,once that egg is completely incorporated do the pother egg. Make sure to scrap the sides of the bowl as well with a spatula.

step3. Now we add in our coco powder. it is a good idea to run it through some kind of a sifter. Coco powder tends to get a bit lumpy. Then mix again and scrape the sides are needed. Throughout this whole process we don't want to over mix, just until things are incorporated. if we mix too much air into in batter which can cause air pockets in opur cake.

step4. Now add in our vanilla extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vinegar. if you don't have buttermilk you can make some by taking just shy one cup of regular milk and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and then let it sit out for about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and vanilla extract until combined.

step5. Now we add in our oil to the buttermilk mixture. Next add in about 2 to 2 and 1/2 Tablespoons of red food coloring liquid. Then stir, until the mixture is a nice red in color. Set that mixture aside for now.

step6. Next we will add our salt and baking soda to our flour. you can use cake flour or all-purpose flour. you can use cake flour or all-purpose flour. Cake flour tends to work a little bit better, but all-purpose works great too. Use a whisk to combine those ingredients.

step7. Next we will add in about half of our food coloring buttermilk mixture and about half of our flour mixture and mix until just combined. Give the side of the bowl a good scrape, then complete the process until all the ingredients have been mixed leaving you with a nice red velvet cake batter.

step8. Now we just fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch cake pans with equal amounts of cake batter. Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pansd and then dust them with cocoa powder or flour and i always add a little round cut out of parchment paper on the bottom too as an added pecaution, and my nonstick pans are great, but i like to over do it. it, this will allow any cake bubbles to rise to the top, wehich helps to prevent air pockets, but sometimes it is unavoidable and you just get them. a combination of over mixing, etc. But it won't effect the taste of the cake at all! So don't worry about it. I never do. lol now bake thiose cakes for 23 to 30 minutes until when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle.

step9. Now after the class come the cakes come out of the oven let's leave them alone and allow them to cool in their pans for about 10 minutes, After that we can remove them from their pans, remove the parchment paper and then let the cake cool completely on the rack. Afterwards you can place the cakes in the fridge and let them chill, which helps with the frosting, or just go onto the frosting step now, it's tottalyup to you!

step10. Well now it is time to make our frosting, we will be using using just a few ingredients, cream cheese, butter,vanilla extract, and of course powered sugar (confectioner's sugar).

step11. Now combine the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract into a large bowl and mix with a hand mixer until nice and smooth usually takes a few minutes. Then slowly incorporate all of the powered sugar. You may need more or less depending on the consiteny that you want. Next just remove the beaters. Frosting is reay to go. At this point if the frosting is still too runny and more powdered sugar, or just chill about 30 minutes before frosting that cake.

step12. first we will trip the cake so it will be somewhat level. You can skip this step if you like. I just always use my bread knife to cut the top off of the bottom layer, if you want to use fondant i recommend cutting the top layer off as well, the end product will look a bit better. Next add a bunch of frosting to the middle, then layer the top layer of cake on. then cover that whole cake with frosting. there are a variety of tools that you can use, I normally just use my cake spatule. Once done put the cake in the fridge for about 30 minutes. This is optional, but i like to do it, allows the frosting to set a bit.

step13. Now i want to make a heart-shaped cake topper. To do that take my heart cookie cutter and cut out a shape from the middle of that piece of cake that i have. that just place it on the top of you cake. Looks pretty near right?

step14. Now take the rest of your leftover cake and crumble it up with your figure. Then gently apply it do your can sides opr on top or skip this step. It is totally up to you how you decorate your cake. :) use a piping bag ande pipe frosting around the top of your heart if you like. You are done! Now place the cake in the fidge for about 2 hours before serving. Enjoy!

NOW THE RED VELVET CAKE IS READY IT'S TIME TO EAT ENJOY!!!!!!!
